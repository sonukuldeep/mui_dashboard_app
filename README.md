# Dashboard app with material design

## Dashboard app using material ui

This app was created by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=coRTRjCQ15U&feature=youtu.be) youtube video by React with Masoud on youtube.

Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design. It includes a comprehensive collection of prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of the box.

A heartly thanks to Masoud, the creator of the tutorial on yt and the open source community without whom this project would never have been possible.
